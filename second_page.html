        <h1><strong>Kathak</strong></h1>
        <p>
            <strong>Kathak</strong> is my favorite hobby and I've been doing it for 9 years now.

            For my graduation, we had to perform ten dances, inculuding my solo, and we
             had a forty minute section with no music that we used to show the footwork 
             and techniques that we learned over the years. The last part of this section
              was doing circles. Here's a short video showing the circles.
